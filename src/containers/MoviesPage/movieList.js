    summary: "This acclaimed animated tale by director Hayao Miyazaki follows schoolgirl Satsuke and her younger sister, Mei, as they settle into an old country house with their father and wait for their mother to recover from an illness in an area hospital. As the sisters explore their new home, they encounter and befriend playful spirits in their house and the nearby forest, most notably the massive cuddly creature known as Totoro.",
    locSummary: "The scenery and movie is based on Sayama Hills, which is known to be a woodland paradise floating amid the reservoirs of Tama and Sayama lakes in northwestern Tokyo. It includes four major parks that draw in visitors for activities (watching cherry blossoms, picnics, pottery and other crafts), trees, creatures and views unique in each area.",

      "The diminutive backwards-talking mystical muppet whose knowledge of the Force is second to none. In the original trilogy he’s a marvel of creature design: tactile, sympathetic and loveable. His CGI incarnation in ‘The Phantom Menace’ looks like a rubber troll sprung unnervingly to life, though this does improve somewhat over the next two movies."

      "Everything about him is iconic: that idiosyncratic manner of speech (part ageing Jewish comedian, part inscrutable samurai warrior), that unique raspy voice (supplied by Frank Oz, so the similarity to Miss Piggy is understandable), the amazing puppet work, even the really-not-so-terrible CGI in the last two prequels (the way he bounces off the walls during the lightsaber battle is amazing)."

    locSummary: "Yakushima is a subtropical island covered mainly by an extensive cedar forest which includes some of Japan’s oldest trees with ages that could reach over 1000 years. The island’s 2000 meter high mountains make it a goodhiking spot, but only for the well-prepared hikers for rain showers happen daily. No one wants to get lost right?",
    summary: "In the 14th century, the harmony that humans, animals and gods have enjoyed begins to crumble. The protagonist, young Ashitaka - infected by an animal attack, seeks a cure from the deer-like god Shishigami. In his travels, he sees humans ravaging the earth, bringing down the wrath of wolf god Moro and his human companion Princess Mononoke. His attempts to broker peace between her and the humans brings only conflict.",

    why: [
      "Because he’s the real hero of the ‘Star Wars’ movies, consistently getting the others out of trouble just when things look their bleakest. From juggling turbolifts on an enemy battleship to save Anakin Skywalker’s miserable life to fixing Luke’s X-Wing stabilisers during the first Death Star run, from mending the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon to cutting his way out of an Ewok trap, Artoo does all the hard galaxy-saving work and gets precious little credit. It’s no surprise he was the first cast member to be confirmed for the third ‘Star Wars’ trilogy: without him the Imperial forces would be ruling the galaxy and Luke, Leia, Han and Chewie would be little more than glutinous splodges on the inside wall of a trash compactor. We’re a little concerned by his behaviour in ‘The Force Awakens’ though – did he really have to leave it so long to tell everyone that he knew where Luke was? Or was he just being dramatic?"

    locSummary: "A preserved medieval city, Gamla Stan (Old Town) is one of Stockholm’s best attractions filled up with narrow cobblestone streets and buildings colored in different shades of gold. You’d pretty much find other magical places in here from one of the largest palaces in the world to the narrowest street in town. Besides the old town, you can even check out Stockholm’s metro art gallery."
